<h1 id="talk-season-is-over">Talk season is over</h1>
<p>Finally, <a href="/talk/season">talk season</a> is over!</p>
<p>I gave five (todepond) talks in one month. Four of them were unique, and all were in different cities / countries. </p>
<h2 id="it-was-a-terrible-idea">It was a terrible idea</h2>
<p>Looking back, it was a terrible idea. I completely overworked / exhausted myself. </p>
<p>On the other hand, it was an intense learning experience. I now feel ten times more seasoned / experienced in giving talks. Doing so many in such a short space of time gave me the chance to get rapid feedback / make rapid adjustments.</p>
<h2 id="with-friends">With friends</h2>
<p>The best part of being part of an event is the &quot;showing up&quot; and being around so many other people.</p>
<p>I saw many old friends, many who I had only seen over a year ago. And I made many new ones, some that I&#39;d never met, only crossed paths with on the internet, or only in fleeting moments before. And those who were entirely new, who didn&#39;t know me, or they did from my blog or something, but either way, it was a chance for me to subject more people to my incessant demo-ing, to give me more practice at presenting / performing / keeping attention. </p>
<h2 id="many-flavours">Many flavours</h2>
<p><a href="https://2024.heartofclojure.eu/">Heart of clojure</a> was a real community event, and truly special.</p>
<p><a href="https://berlin.causalislands.com/">Causal islands</a> was more political, a wannabe <a href="https://www.thestrangeloop.com/">Strange loop</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://liveprog.org/">LIVE</a> was fake academia. </p>
<p><a href="https://2024.splashcon.org/track/splash-2024-Onward-Essays#About">Onward</a> was real academia, but still a bit cheeky, so I&#39;m told.</p>
<p>Oh and there was also <a href="https://lu.ma/foclondon">futures of coding</a>, which is way more performance-oriented, like an open mic night.</p>
<h2 id="what-it-means-to-be-open">What it means to be open</h2>
<p>I was really pleased with how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJzV0CX0q8o">What it means to be open</a> went. It was my first ever opening keynote and that was very nerve-wracking for me. But I couldn&#39;t have picked a better venue / community / mentor for it. Thank you to the European clojure community and <a href="https://toot.cat/@plexus">Arne</a> for all the support.</p>

<h2 id="death-of-the-tadi-web">Death of the tadi web</h2>
<p>I presented <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft6xOAijwFo">Death of the tadi web</a> twice! Once at London&#39;s Future Coding. Once as a longer keynote at Causal Islands Berlin. And I think the future of coding version went better! But we&#39;ll find out for sure when the causal islands video recording comes out. It&#39;s perhaps my most campy talk yet, and dangerously close to <a href="https://github.com/TodePond/DreamBerd">Dreamberd</a> territory.</p>

<h2 id="unblocking-creation-with-friends">Unblocking creation with friends</h2>
<p>At first, I felt the pressure to top my talk from last year&#39;s LIVE, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQgxFuw8f1U">Spatial programming without escape</a>. But with a shorter duration and a wildly different topic, it seemed like this year&#39;s presentation would exist on its own. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/live/4GOeYylCMJI?t=12475">Unblocking creation with friends</a> (which starts at 3:27:56) was a pretty straightforward lift from the essay that I&#39;d already written, which was also called <a href="/report/arroost">Unblocking creation with friends</a>. And I&#39;m pleased with how it went. It seems like people &quot;got it&quot;.</p>

<h2 id="dialogues-on-natural-code">Dialogues on natural code</h2>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/bV12HhAYIik?si=kr_7UKz1D7UHJUwS">Dialogues on natural code</a> was my first step into <strong>real</strong> academia, as it was based on our <strong>real</strong> published paper / essay / stage play: <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3689492.3689807">Dialogues on natural code</a>.</p>
<p>This talk went the least to plan, but that doesn&#39;t mean it went badly. In fact, my timing fuck-ups may have actually made the talk better, unintentionally. I haven&#39;t properly watched this one back yet, so I&#39;ll need to take a closer look. </p>
<p>I haven&#39;t properly published the video yet, as I&#39;ve been doing some audio fixup. Here&#39;s the latest draft: </p>

<h2 id="i-m-a-keynote-speaker-now">I&#39;m a keynote speaker now</h2>
<p>I guess this all makes me a keynote speaker now! (not just a non-keynote speaker) </p>
<p>I don&#39;t have any more todepond talks lined up right now, but I&#39;m looking forward to getting some scheduled in after I reflect on these ones and figure out how to do better. </p>
<h2 id="what-s-next-">What&#39;s next?</h2>
<p>I did submit a workshop for <a href="https://iclc.toplap.org/2025/">ICLC</a>, so we&#39;ll see how that goes. The workshop is about <a href="/explore/cellpond">Cellpond</a>, and it explicitly makes links between Cellpond and &quot;living computation&quot;, which is part of my <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3689492.3689807">Natural code</a>.</p>
<p>I&#39;m also getting way more involved in <a href="https://strudel.cc">strudel</a> and <a href="https://flok.cc">flok</a> and the creative live programming world. So expect a lot <a href="https://youtu.be/jdFSmr3koXg?si=spsq5X_t4k37iCmM">more work</a> from me on that. </p>
<p><a href="https://tornleaf.gallery">Torn leaf zero</a> is on my plate next. I&#39;m looking forward to sharing people&#39;s submissions with the world. If you want to get involved, there&#39;s still time to submit something to the exhibition. (There are no deadlines at torn leaf).</p>
<p>And I&#39;m still working on the next video, <strong>Top 99 Ways To Make Sand</strong>. I&#39;m working towards a teaser trailer, which will hopefully be out by the end of the year. The real video will almost certainly be out at some point during 2025. It&#39;s the longest gap ever between videos and part of the reason for that is all these talks I&#39;ve been giving. Another reason is that the video will be over twenty minutes long. Thank you for your patience. </p>
<h2 id="theme">Theme</h2>
<p>The emerging theme behind all of my imminent work is &quot;repetition&quot;. It&#39;s what binds together all of these sometimes-seemingly unrelated projects. </p>
<p>&quot;Algorave generation. We love repetition.&quot; Or whatever the <a href="https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/scrappy-fiddles/sharing/normalising/live/">phrase</a> is. </p>
<p>And the repetition needed to run non-deterministic <a href="https://youtu.be/bV12HhAYIik?si=kr_7UKz1D7UHJUwS">natural code</a>. </p>
<p>And the repeated &quot;better computing&quot; movements of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft6xOAijwFo">tadi web</a>. </p>
<p>And the repeated <a href="https://tornleaf.gallery">torn leaf logos</a>. </p>
<p>And the repetitive job of making 99 sands in different ways.</p>
<h2 id="the-future">The future</h2>
<p>It&#39;s no secret that I want to do this todepond work full-time. I won&#39;t be ready to do that for a while, but I&#39;m gradually heading in that direction: Towards TOTAL TODEPOND.</p>

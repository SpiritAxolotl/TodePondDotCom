# The problem with independent researchers

*This is a horror story based on true events.*

<br>

Twenty to thirty independent researchers sat down in a circle.

They all shared their struggles with [building community](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/blending/goals/community/) and working with others. 

"Do you think you could share your work more openly?"

"No."

<br>

*The end.*

# Role models

When I was a teacher, I was lucky enough to have many role models. 

<br>

It was a large school, with many great teachers and leaders.

But it began even before that, with my first advisor during teacher training. We continued meeting for many years after. I learned a lot from her. 

Then—

Let me list them all out. I'm thinking of specific people here. I'll use code names to keep it anonymous. 

1. Flow
2. Line
3. Make
4. Stick
5. Kid
6. Love
7. Stone
8. Win

Yes, that's all of them. Don't worry about the words. It's just so they're anonymous / so I can remember who they are. 

For sure, I learned from others too. But I would say that those eight were my role models. 

And of course, I have role models outside my work as well. But this blog post is about my work related role models.

Now that I'm in tech, I have new role models. And it's taken quite a while to find them all. 

But I still think about those eight originals, quite often. 

<br>

Through my two careers, I've met many many many people, and most of them don't become role models to me. 

This sometimes includes rejecting a role model that others think I should have. I don't always / I'm not always inspired by the person you think I should be inspired by. I'm not always impressed by the same person as you.

That's not unique to me. Everyone has to pick their own role models, based on some— on what's important to them.

Choosing a role model isn't something you have to think about. No, it happens automatically instead.

You see someone and they're— Whenever you see someone / listen to someone / come across someone, you may or may not start to see them as a role model. It's largely automatic, I think. 

I certainly don't think about it very much. It just happens / happens on its own.

So here we are.

Now that I have these role models, from tech and teaching, I can take a step back and look at them all. I can ask: 

- Who are they?
- What do they have in common? 

<br>

<br>

All of my role models are extremely patient and all of my role models are extremely humble. They're focused on boosting other people up, not on furthering their own name.

And I can ask myself: Am I that? Am I that too? Have I become that yet?


And of course the answer is no. Definitely not. Not yet. But hey I'm trying to get better.

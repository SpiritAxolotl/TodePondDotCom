# Sharing scrappy fiddles is hard

I have a mantra:

> Normalise sharing scrappy fiddles.

It's when you [make it more socially acceptable](https://www.todepond.com/sky/normalise-dont-share-lol) to show-and-tell half-baked creations. The important part is that the sharer feels a bit shy about whatever they're sharing. It's about allowing more people to share [the ongoing process](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/scrappy-fiddles/sharing/normalising/live/), not just the end.

## Sharing scrappy fiddles is not easy

Some people criticise the act of "sharing scrappy fiddles" like this:

They say that sharing scrappy fiddles is not easy!

They say it's not a worthwhile thing to do because it's hard. It can be time-consuming. It steals your time and energy that can be better spent on other things. It's tricky to do it consistently, or in a way that's accessible to other people. It leaves you feeling vulnerable. It's hard to know how to do it: In person? Online? And in either case, where?

## Sharing scrappy fiddles is hard

I never thought or said that sharing scrappy fiddles was easy. That's the whole point! I'm glad we see this the same way. 

Sharing scrappy fiddles is currently WAY TOO DIFFICULT in the world we live in. 

That's why we need to normalise sharing scrappy fiddles: To make it easier for those who want to, or have no choice, [like me](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/health/transition/in-slow-motion/).

I mean... this should be obvious, right? If sharing scrappy fiddles was easy, then we wouldn't need to normalise it!

*When* sharing scrappy fiddles is easy, then we will have finally normalised it.

## Normalise

Normalise sharing scrappy fiddles. Not because it is easy, but because it is hard.

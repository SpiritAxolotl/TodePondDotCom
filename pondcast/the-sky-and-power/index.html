    TODEPOND PONDCAST: The sky
  </h1>

  <p>Welcome back to another weekly-ish episode of the...</p>
  <p>üê∏ TODEPOND PONDCAST üê∏</p>
  <p>
    It&#39;s another two parter because I missed last week because I was in
    Berlin for‚Äî I&#39;ll get to that.
  </p>
  <p>What&#39;s new these past two weeks?</p>
  <img src="1.png" />
  <h2 id="deaths-of-the-tadi-web">Deaths of the tadi web</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="https://todepond.com/talk/season">Talk season</a> continues. In
    preparation for my keynote at
    <a
      href="https://causalislands.com/berlin/initial-speaker-announcements-and-cfp/"
      >Berlin Causal Islands</a
    >, I gave a shorter, twenty minute version at
    <a href="https://lu.ma/foclondon">London Futures of Coding</a> two days
    before the real deal.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was quite campy! Watch it
    <a href="https://youtu.be/ft6xOAijwFo">here</a>. Luckily, multiple people
    filmed it again, so I was able to stitch together a complete recording. I
    did this once before with the little
    <a href="https://youtu.be/cF2OF75ivZM">Arroost demo</a> I gave there.
  </p>
  <p>The recording of the longer Berlin talk will be out at some point too.</p>
  <p>
    Funnily enough, I actually prefer the shorter version! Either way, it&#39;ll
    be nice for people to see both. I might talk a bit about them on the next
    pondcast, but I don&#39;t want to give out any spoilers right now.
  </p>
  <img src="2.png" />
  <h2 id="dialogues">Dialogues</h2>
  <p>
    I&#39;ve been preparing for the talk I&#39;m giving at
    <a href="https://2024.splashcon.org/track/splash-2024-Onward-Essays"
      >Onward</a
    >
    at <a href="https://2024.splashcon.org/">SPLASH</a> in Los Angeles. I&#39;m
    presenting the essay that
    <a href="https://www.cs.unm.edu/~ackley/">Dave Ackley</a> and I
    <a
      href="https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/academia/natural-code/submitted/"
      >wrote together</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    Part of the puzzle has been figuring out how to include both me and Dave in
    the talk, as the whole point of the essay is the &quot;dialogue&quot; that
    we have between us. And Dave&#39;s not attending in-person!
  </p>
  <p>
    Originally, we were planning to do some sort of live video feed thing, with
    Dave joining remotely. But as time went on (and reality sunk in), we decided
    to scope it down. The current plan is to include a pre-recorded video of
    Dave in the middle section of the talk!
  </p>
  <p>
    In my talks, the middle section is usually the demo segment. It&#39;s where
    I show the thing I&#39;ve been working on. In this case, the thing I&#39;ve
    been doing is having back-and-forth communications with Dave. So it checks
    out!
  </p>
  <img src="3.png" />
  <h2 id="tentpole">Tentpole</h2>
  <p>
    We created a computer collective! It&#39;s called
    <a href="https://tentpole.computer/">Tentpole</a>. It&#39;s something that
    me and my friend <a href="https://www.orionreed.com/">Orion Reed</a> have
    been talking about for a while. And now, it&#39;s four of us, a network of
    four friends who want to support each other:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://trimmings.wtf/">Philippa Markovics</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://elliot.website/">Elliot Evans</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.orionreed.com/">Orion Reed</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.todepond.com/">me</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We&#39;ve got very big very very long term plans for Tentpole, so stay tuned
    for a very very very long time.
  </p>
  <p>
    (And sign up to our mailing list on the
    <a href="https://tentpole.computer/">website</a>.)

  <h1 id="todepond-pondcast-power">TODEPOND PONDCAST: Power</h1>
  <p>It&#39;s time for another! Here we go!</p>
  <img src="4.png" />
  <h2 id="open">Open</h2>
  <p>
    The recording of my
    <a href="https://2024.heartofclojure.eu/talks/what-it-means-to-be-open/"
      >opening keynote</a
    >
    is out! Watch it
    <a href="https://youtu.be/MJzV0CX0q8o?si=tGTPZ6jP9UEywXFI">here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I&#39;m really pleased with how this one went, and
    <a href="https://2024.heartofclojure.eu/">Heart of Clojure</a> was a really
    special conference to be part of. I&#39;m still processing it to be honest!
    I&#39;m still gathering up my learnings from it.
  </p>
  <p>
    My only regret from the talk is that I accidentally said &quot;six
    years&quot; at one point, when I was supposed to say &quot;five
    years&quot;... It doesn&#39;t sound too bad, but it got an applause, so I
    feel like a bit of a fraud. I muddled up my lines from the previous slide.
    It was supposed to be &quot;six years&quot; on the first slide, and then
    &quot;five years&quot; on the following slide. But I said &quot;six
    years&quot; on both.
  </p>
  <p>
    Still, I can&#39;t quite believe I&#39;ve been posting up one NEW THING
    EVERY DAY for over five years.....................
  </p>

  <h2 id="screen-tree">Screen tree</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="https://elliot.website/">Elliot Evans</a> is part of
    <a href="https://tentpole.computer/">Tentpole</a>. He&#39;s also a
    researcher-in-residence at
    <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/">Ink &amp; Switch</a>,
    <a href="https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/research/er-in-residence/"
      >like me</a
    >. And within his residency, he&#39;s exploring how to visually and
    dynamically represent complicated things. In the past, he&#39;s done this
    for different kinds of
    <a
      href="https://vezwork.github.io/polylab/dist/demo/articles/exploring_spaces/"
      >SPACES</a
    >. And now he&#39;s doing it for
    <a
      href="https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/academia/citation/cant-find-it/"
      >RECURSION and REPETITION</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    Elliot&#39;s thing is similar, but also different, to
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4OIcwt8vcE">Screenpond</a> in
    various ways, so it&#39;s been really interesting to compare the two. This
    has led to me adding some more features to Screenpond.
  </p>
  <p>
    Temporarily, you can see white lines on
    <a href="https://screenpond.cool/">Screenpond itself</a> to see which
    screens are &#39;children&#39; of other screens.
  </p>
  <p>
    And you can now hold the space bar while manipulating a screen to allow it
    to &#39;escape&#39; a screen while still
    <a href="https://mas.to/@TodePond/113288200612137290"
      >remaining a child of it</a
    >. It sounds a bit abstract, because it is! I hope to try to make it more
    concrete as time goes on.

  <h2 id="power">Power</h2>
  <p>
    And of course, I&#39;ve been preparing for my other talk, my
    <a
      href="https://2024.splashcon.org/details/live-2024-papers/12/Arroost-Unblocking-creation-with-friends"
      >presentation</a
    >
    of <a href="https://www.todepond.com/explore/arroost/">Arroost</a> at
    <a href="https://liveprog.org/">LIVE</a> at
    <a href="https://2024.splashcon.org/">SPLASH</a> in Los Angeles.
  </p>
  <p>
    So of course, I&#39;ve been working through all of the feedback I got from
    reviewers. In previous weeks of this pondcast, I&#39;ve addressed the
    simpler / more basic points. Now we&#39;re onto the real good / juicy stuff.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the recurring themes in Arroost is POWER. Who holds the power? You or
    the tool? Or the community? Or me? And who is control of the tool? And who
    <em>should</em> be in control?
  </p>
  <p>
    Letting go of control/power is helpful because it means you let go of
    responsibility. If something sounds bad, it&#39;s not your fault! It&#39;s
    Arroost&#39;s fault. This removes emotional blockers and sets you free.
  </p>
  <p>
    This can also be a downside. It means that the user of the tool doesn&#39;t
    have agency over it. Here&#39;s what Reviewer B said about it:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      I really appreciate how Arroost explicitly grapples with the notion of
      power. An interesting lens to consider this might be the one taken by
      <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3586183.3606831">this paper</a>
      that I quite enjoy. Here‚Äôs a snippet of the abstract:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Researchers who build creativity support tools (CSTs) define
        abstractions and software representations that align with user needs to
        give users the power to accomplish tasks. However, these specifications
        also structure and limit how users can and should think, act, and
        express themselves. Thus, tool designers unavoidably exert power over
        their users by enacting a ‚Äúnormative ground‚Äù through their tools.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The paper makes it clear that these power relations are unavoidable and
      something that should be reckoned with explicitly, which I think Arroost
      does very nicely.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>And they continue:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      I find the role of the community in Arroost to be fascinating as well.
      It‚Äôs clear that some areas are off limits ‚Äî like changing the behavior of
      Arroost to disable the pitch bending from the passage I quoted above ‚Äî but
      it‚Äôs also clear that Arroost as a software artifact is in dialogue with
      members of its community via, e.g., pull requests. What impact does
      Arroost being in this intermediate space have on users and their
      relationship to their music production software? In what ways does Arroost
      align with or distance itself from
      <a
        href="https://userpages.umbc.edu/~skane/classes/is760/fall2011/papers/Muller2008.pdf"
        >participatory design</a
      >
      and its normative goals?
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Reviewer C brings up this theme as well:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      An essential component in emotionally unblocking design seems to be the
      user ceding control / granting agency to the tool, the degree to which
      varies widely.\ On one end, there&#39;s tldraw taking control of its
      marks&#39; imperfect styling to discourage pixel-perfect alignment, or
      controlling how arrows are drawn so that they look nice, but otherwise
      leaving the user full manual control of the overall scene (ignoring
      makereal for the moment).
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other end, there are tools like Electroplankton and Arroost that
      control the high-level coordination patterns between lower-level
      primitives. I&#39;m interested in these comparisons because I wonder how
      the user-control-ceding nature of emotionally unblocking design may or may
      not translate to tools that do afford high user control.
    </p>
    <p>
      As another example, there&#39;s LLM-powered autocomplete a la tldraw&#39;s
      makereal, which seems to sit somewhere in the middle of the spectrum: it
      may be hard to predict the suggestion, but it&#39;s still scoped to the
      user&#39;s prompt and some section of the edit state. How else might we
      navigate these trade-offs between user control and creative unblocking?
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Right... I&#39;ve just dumped a load of reviewer feedback on you there.</p>
  <p>
    Both reviewers talk about &quot;power&quot; (or &quot;control&quot;) from
    different perspectives. Reviewer B talks about it from a social / community
    point of view. Reviewer C talks about usability / functionality. But both
    touch on a tension between the user and creator.
  </p>
  <p>
    My very very boring answer is that I don&#39;t know what this all means yet.
    I don&#39;t know how to respond to this point of feedback. It&#39;s
    extremely thought-provoking. It asks deep questions about what&#39;s
    important to us (when we&#39;re making creative tools). It&#39;s exactly the
    kind of conversation I want to create / prompt with Arroost.
  </p>
  <p>Let&#39;s see how it goes!</p>

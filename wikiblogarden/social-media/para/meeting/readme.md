# It's weird when people recognise me 

I am increasingly exposed to people recognising me when I attend events. It's weird, because I often don't know them.

It's not much really. It's barely anything at all, but it's weird when it happens. 

Someone will come up to me and.. I'm getting better at noticing the look in their eye when they approach that gives it away / that gives away that they watch my videos or read my blog or something. 

Like it's a slight look of shock or something. Like a "Wow I've read about you [going to the loo](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/health/loo-lu/end/)" kind of look, or something.

Anyway I tend to introduce myself in these situations because it's weirder if they just stand and stare.

## It's okay to say hi

Yeah of course it's okay to say hi. I'm a real person, it's fine. 

## Unless it's not

People are sometimes surprised that I don't speak with that [calm voice](https://youtu.be/54cK-XLu-s0?si=470FgJlo8vpOrfBa) I use in my videos. I'm actually very energetic in real life. That definitely surprises some people. And I'm quite tall. People sometimes comment on that. 

And people sometimes ask for my insight or advice or whatever, on certain things. And I guess I answer truthfully, but I'm just a person. I don't think I match up with the "imagined Lu" they have in their head.

Still it's really nice to meet these people, and I feel extremely privileged for (almost) every encounter.

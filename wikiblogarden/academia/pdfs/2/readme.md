# PDFs are so bad 2

Ha! what's that?\
you thought I was [done](/wikiblogarden/academia/pdfs)?
PDFs are so so bad\
I couldn't only do one

my hatred can't be contained\
to a single post\
here's part two to my poem\
on why I hate—\
why I hate PDFs the most

<br>

PDFs are so so bad\
that I—

Look\
you can't even zoom\
on your phone\
without spreading your—\
it takes up the whole screen\
and two columns is just\
Uh!\
it's a mess

Listen\
to all the gatekeeping around\
about papers with their\
fancy headers\
ACM approved\
formatting and\
templating too

No wonder\
the field\
is not diverse\
when barrier to entry\
is painful at best\
and locked at worst:

Inclusion hidden behind\
a command line\
when you're considered apart\
from the in-group\
lacking esoteric guidance\
on esoteric practice\
in an esoteric world\
of PDFs

And who do we reach out to?\
Who do we train?\
Is it those who look different?\
Or those who look the same?

"Anyone can do it!"\
But they don't!\
They don't!

Maybe they could!\
I think that they could\
but they don't\
Have you considered that they don't?\
and why that might be?

The barriers that stop us\
may be big\
may be small\
every annoyance is a failing\
to be more open\
to reach more of us all

If academia can't deal\
with something as small\
as PDFs\
then what hope is there\
for tackling the rest?

what hope is there?\
there's none\
there's no way to win\
academia is done\
put it in the bin

Not to mention the text\
that you—\
most of the time you\
can't even drag to select\
copy and paste captures\
line numbers and clutter and\
garbage pure garbage\
trash trash trash\
it always goes wrong\
it's a pain in my—

*What do we do when something is rubbish?*

What do we do when something is rubbish?\
We put it in the bin\
Put it in the bin\
Put it in the—

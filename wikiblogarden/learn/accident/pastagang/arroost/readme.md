# PASTAGANG: I learned a programming language by accident

It was an accident!!

<br>

<hr>

<br>

Sometimes I look back and try to figure out how I got here.

I vividly remember the day I decided to start making [videos](https://youtube.com/@todepond?si=KmQIA3azT3bh0J_h). I was at a cafe in a library. We were waiting there before a show.

It was a start. It wasn't *the* start. It was *a* start. One of many moments that led to many things: A connection I can only see now. I couldn't see it then. I didn't have the hindsight I needed.

<br>

Time passed and I followed my nose. I followed my nose and some of the things that I made for fun took me to new places. Like [cellpond](https://youtu.be/xvlsJ3FqNYU?si=TftA8rt346BZqO4H) that got me into [academia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQgxFuw8f1U) and [screenpond](https://youtu.be/Q4OIcwt8vcE?si=GPZizrXJAWSslEmO) that got me [my job](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJzV0CX0q8o).

In any case, it was an accident: A complete accident. I didn't mean for those projects to lead to those rewards, but I'm thankful that they did.

<br>

And either way, I learned a lot. Not because I set out to. It wasn't intentional, no. No, it naturally happened: A natural by-product of what I was already doing.

<br>

# Part one: ARROOST

My explorations led me to making a tool called [arroost](https://youtu.be/DNBKdU6XrLY?si=4ISQhHUkkqSsK8sU). I wanted to combine / blend together a lot of the things that I had learned into one. I wanted to see what would happen. And what happened was: 

I made a [live coding](https://youtu.be/-QY2x6aZzqc?si=3UcKF0iYy3BdVKSf) tool by accident.  I had no idea what live coding was, but I made a live coding tool (apparently). 

I know this because some people from the— Hey I already wrote a [blog post about this](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/scrappy-fiddles/sharing/normalising/live/).

<br>

## Live coding

Despite starting out with [silliness](https://youtu.be/wWFfhaOWJ1Y?si=FK1rgpw7e60C9n_q), I now take my work very [seriously](https://youtu.be/9mbs0sx3z2A?si=wdtGQF-uvUsccVVc), whatever my work is. Is it research? art? i don't know but anyway whatever it is i take it seriously.

So when you— when I discover that I've accidentally made something, it is important for me— for you to learn more about what that thing that you've— that I've made *is*.

"I've made a live coding tool, so I need to learn what that means."

<br>

<br>

Obviously, the best way to learn is not by reading and studying and listening. No, the best way to learn is by [doing](https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/learn/how/).

So... for the past year or so, I have been trying to throw myself fully into the live coding world. I've been trying to participate, so that when it inevitably— with the hope that, when it became time to [write](/report/arroost) or [speak](http://www.youtube.com/live/4GOeYylCMJI?t=12475) about arroost, I would be ready.

And, yes! I did manage to include some notes about live coding in my work: In the [essay](/report/arroost) and the [talk](http://www.youtube.com/live/4GOeYylCMJI?t=12475) and the [blog post](http://www.youtube.com/live/4GOeYylCMJI?t=12475).

But there's always more I can do. I regret not being able to reference [Laurie Spiegel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLd1RUDmX6w&list=PLlBhjvPmxc9EyPd0Lz6GiNg71n_204XeP&index=1) but I still haven't engrossed myself enough in her stuff.

And work on [arroost](/explore/arroost) has only just begun. Similar to [cellpond](/explore/cellpond), I'll keep returning to it over the course of several years to attempt to learn more and more.

<br>

And as [talk season](https://www.todepond.com/talk/season/over) has now closed, I find myself getting asked by myself and others, "What's next?"

What's next for arroost and my work on [normalising sharing scrappy fiddles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJzV0CX0q8o)?

<br>

So what *is* next? Well...

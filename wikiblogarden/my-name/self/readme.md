# Yourself

carve your own path
go your own way
you can't be anybody else 
you can't be anyone but 

pick your own fight
reach your own goal
you can't be anybody else
you can't be anyone but

do your own task
tell your own tale
sing your own song
dance your own dance

be your own self
be your whole own self
you can't be anybody no
you can't be anyone else

you can't be anybody anyone
anybody anyone
you can't be anybody anyone
apart from yourself
